  We are a group of volunteers who work to improve the quality of
  McAleer Creek, Lyon Creek, and the surrounding watershed. Our
  primary activity is monitoring water quality in our streams.
  Stream monitoring is a great activity for anyone interested
  in the health of our streams. It is also a great opportunity
  for students to get community service hours and have fun doing it. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  You can play a larger role in LFP Streamkeepers by joining our small,
  friendly Steering Committee. Email one of the contacts for more information.

<h2>Coming Up Next</h2>

<h3>Saturday September 22, 2012: <br>BIBI Monitoring Event</h3>
<p>StreamKeepers conducts its annual inventory of insects in
  McAleer and Lyon Creeks on one Saturday in late September or early
  October. Insect collection is done in teams and training is provided. 
  This activity consists of collecting aquatic insects
  and other small organisms from small areas of the stream beds in
  several locations. The samples collected will be analyzed by a trained
  entomologist, with results available in several weeks. We follow a
  process developed by a UW professor, which is technically known as BIBI
  (Benthic Inventory of Biologic Integrity). </p>
  <p>
  This inventory is perhaps the most important stream monitoring activity
  we do, as it gives a basic assessment of overall stream health that can
  be compared with other streams in Western Washington. It is also the
  most fun, and a good way to become "intimately" familiar with our
  streams. </p>
<p>Anyone interested in helping is most welcome to join us!
  Please contact Mark Phillips (msphillips1 (at) comcast.net or
  206-388-7284) for information about our meeting location and time. <br></p>
<h3>Saturday, January 19, 2013 9AM: <br>Basic Water Quality Monitoring</h3>
  We maintain a twice yearly testing schedule for basic
  quality monitoring: typically the third Saturday in January and the third
  Saturday in July. Please join us on the lower level of
  the Lake Forest Park Town Center mall. We are
  usually done by 11:00. All are welcome!
