	    On October 9, 2004 LFP StreamKeepers collected two Macroinvertebrate
	    Samples, one from Lyon creek and another from McAleer creek.  
	    <p>
	    Both samples fell towards the high end of the "Poor" category.
	    Sobering results, but we should be careful about reaching conclusions until we 
	    get a little more perspective on what they mean, and how they compare with other 
	    urban stream results.  
	    <p>
	    So now we've got to educate ourselves about what it means. For example is there any 
	    diagnostic value to the data...does the array of data suggest any direction to look 
	    for specific factors contributing to the low scores?  Any more specialized follow 
	    up tests that might help us prioritize future stream improvement activities?
	    <p>
	    The city of Lake Forest Park footed the bill (About $180) for the data 
	    analysis. As this program
	    expands we may have to look in to providing our own funding. 
	    <p>
	    Here are two relevant websites; there are many.  The first looks like it's produced 
	    by the UW, and probably with a lot of input from Jim Karr.  The second is from the 
	    City of Issaquah, and includes a nice simple summary of the overall BIBI scoring 
	    system and each of the 10 indicators.
