											<b>Basic Chemical Characteristics:</b>
										</P>
										<P><U>What &amp; why we test:</U> This testing includes dissolved oxygen (DO), pH 
											(acidity), temperature, and turbidity.
										</P>
										<p><U>How we test:</U> Four times a year—Spring, Summer, Fall, and 
											Winter—StreamKeeper volunteers gather in the lower LFP Mall, then divide into <IMG title="BIBI Testing" style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid"

											four teams that each go out and test three locations (12 in all) for basic 
											chemical characteristics. Each team totes one of the bright red, green, blue, 
											or yellow color-coded testing boxes, which includes the sampling equipment, 
											protocols, and driving directions.
										</p>
										<p>This year our numbers have steadily increased! We always make sure to pair up 
											newcomers with seasoned StreamKeepers to learn the protocols and find the 
											locations!
										</p>
										<p><U>Results:</U> Consistently very good to excellent. These basic water 
											characteristics are necessary for stream life, and especially fish.
										</p>
										<P><STRONG>Fecal Coliform (FC) Levels:</STRONG>
										</P>
										<P><U>What &amp; why we test:</U> Fecal coliform is a bacteria almost always 
											associated with feces from warm-blooded animals. It’s generally considered more 
											benign than its nasty cousin, the e coli bacteria; however, the presence fecal 
											coliform is an indicator that e-coli is also present. Fecal coliform (FC) 
											bacteria may occur as a result of nonpoint sources of human and animal waste, 
											or the overflow of domestic sewage. (Note: Mountlake Terrace had two raw sewage 
											overflow incidents into Lyons Creek in 2005.) The presence of fecal 
											contamination is an indicator that there is a potential health risk for people 
											or animals exposed to this water. Waterborne pathogenic diseases include viral 
											and bacterial gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A.
										</P>
										<P><U>How we test:</U> FC levels are measured by number of colonies cultured in a 
											laboratory from a 100-milliliter sample of water.
										</P>
										<P><U>Results:</U> The state standard for streams such as ours is 50 colonies (per 
											100-millimeter). Our actual results, provided by the City of Everett, are 
											consistently higher—4 to 5 times higher in some locations. These results are 
											not necessarily alarming, however. Fish and other creatures that live in the 
											streams seem to be able to tolerate periodic fluctuations in this range. 
											However, you and I (and our pets) should not drink the water!

											stream-dwellers. These stream-dwellers depend on macroinvertebrates as a food 
											source. Counting the number and types of macroinvertebrates helps determine if 
											our streams can sustain life.
										</P>
										<P dir="ltr"><U>How we test:</U> We have recently begun using a sampling and 
											testing procedure developed at the U of W, call the Benthic Inventory of 
											Biological Integrity (BIBI, for short). (The protocol was developed by James 
											Karr, UW, <a href="http://www.fish.washington.edu/people/karr/">http://www.fish.washington.edu/people/karr/</a>). 
											This process uses a sample of organic material from a 12 in. square area of 
											stream bottom, and inventories the macroinvertebrate creatures present (aquatic 
											insects, worms, small mollusks). In summer of 2005, about 15 LFP StreamKeeper 
											and LFP Stewardship volunteers gathered for video and hands-on BIBI training in 
											the protocols of the BIBI testing under the direction of our co-leaders, Mark 
											Phillips and Don Fiene. The Shoreline/Lake Forest Park "Enterprise" newspaper 
											featured the new activity as a <a href="http://www.enterprisenewspapers.com/index.cfm?action=story&amp;storyid=20057141548551">
												cover story article</a>.
										</P>
										<P dir="ltr"><U>Results:</U> The limited test results from an initial sampling last 
											year--Oct. 2004—showed both streams in the “Poor” category. (Note: We will 
											update this report as soon as the lab provides 2005 results.)

										<P><STRONG>The Good News</STRONG>
										</P>
										<P>Our streams continue to be wonderful resources that connect us to the natural 
											world, whether we’re fortunate enough to live near one or simply catch glimpses 
											as we make our daily rounds. It is heartening to know that there are still a 
											few places, on McAleer Creek especially, that are probably not much different 
											than they were 200 years ago—a few places. And, our streams still are home to a 
											variety of living creatures, including fish, crayfish, salamanders, insects, 
											worms and mollusks, and the other creatures, like birds and raccoons, that feed 
											on them. But, unfortunately, the picture is changing.
										</P>
										<P><STRONG>A Shadow of Things to Come?</STRONG>
										</P>
										<P>When you look at a snapshot of the data, it looks like good news; but that's not 
											the whole picture of stream health.
										</P>
										<P><U>Animals in decline?</U> The bad news is that both the variety and numbers of 
											stream-resident animals seems to be in steady decline. Long-term residents tell 
											of salmon runs on Lyon Creek, until about 20 years ago – but none have been 
											seen in recent years. McAleer Creek still has small, remnant salmon runs, 
											undoubtedly aided by annual stocking by elementary schools and others. Several 
											beautiful large salamanders were found recently on Brookside Creek, a tributary 
											of McAleer, but generally salamanders are very rare. And has anyone seen (or 
											heard!) a frog in LFP lately? This decline in types of animals is supported by 
											the results of our BIBI testing. If life in our streams continues to disappear, 
											we have the real future scenario of streams that are essentially devoid of 
											life. Like installation art displays, they might still be interesting to 
											behold, but essentially dead.
										</P>
										<P><U>Is erosion the root cause?</U> From available data, a good case can be made 
											that the most serious threat to our streams is not chemical pollution, but 
											erosion. Over the years, as we have developed along the streams and engineered 
											them to suit our purposes; the natural vegetation buffers, wetlands, and flood 
											plains that border streams have been greatly reduced.
										</P>
										<P>Our streams are now very susceptible to extreme erosion during extended periods 
											of heavy rain. In Lake Forest Park, in too many places, our streams flow 
											through artificial, hard channels that increase the velocity of flow. This 
											change to the natural, meandering flow causes great amounts of silt. This 
											channeling, in turn, changes the nature of the streambeds in many areas, 
											creating an inhospitable environment for the insects and other creatures which 
											are adapted to live in the spaces between rocks, and which form the base of the 
											stream ecosystem.

									<h4><a name="schedule">2006 Monitoring Schedule</a></h4>
									<p>Please join us for stream sampling. Stream monitoring is a great activity for 
										young environmentalists and a good way for students to earn community service 
										credits. Monitoring events are scheduled for Saturdays:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
										Basic stream chemical characteristics: Stream monitoring sessions are typically 
										scheduled for the 3rd Saturday of the 1st month in each quarter (e.g. January, 
										April, July, and October). We gather in the lower level of the Lake Forest Park 
										Towne Center mall at 9:00 AM, and are done by about 11:00 AM.
										<li>
										Fecal coliform (FC): Sampling will be scheduled for April &amp; September.
										<li>
											BIBI: Sample collection will be scheduled between Sept 15th and October 15th.
										</li>
