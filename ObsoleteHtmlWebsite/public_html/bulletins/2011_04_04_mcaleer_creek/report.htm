  <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Largest of two stream systems in Lake Forest Park &#45; <br/>other stream is Lyon Creek.</li>
    <li>Originates at Lake Ballinger, outflows into Lake Washington, <br/>a distance of almost 6 miles.</li>
    <li>Tributaries include Hillside Creek, Sheridan Creek, Brookside Creek, and Whisper Creek</li>
    <li>Increasingly prone to flooding &#45; $4 million property damage in lower reaches in 2007. Stretches of the stream are scoured out, and other stretches heavily silted resulting from high volumes of water during major storm events.</li>
    <li>Relatively free of barriers to fish passage although some sections are heavily armored.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Habitat</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Small annual salmon runs: Coho, Chinook, Sockeye</li>
    <li>Supports a wide variety of other animal life, including racoons, beavers, mountain beavers, coyotes, amphibians, herons and other birds, cutthroat trout, peamouth chub, crayfish and other crustaceans, insects, mollusks, and worms</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Water Quality</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Dissolved oxygen levels generally very good: 9 &#45; 14 mg/liter.</li>
    <li>pH consistently very good &#45; 7.5 (At 4, fish reproduction is affected; at 3 fish die.) </li>
    <li>BIBI (Benthic Inventory of Biological Integrity) 2010 ratings 30 and  32, or &quot;Fair.&quot;  (The highest score possible is 50, which would be a stream in a natural, undisturbed area. The lowest score possible is 10 &#45; Thornton Creek several years ago.)</li>
    <li>Some locations have elevated levels of fecal coliform, probably due to failing septic systems along two tributaries.</li>
    <li>Possible pre&#45;spawn mortality (female Coho salmon die with in hours
    of entering stream &#45; very common around Puget Sound area).</li>
    <li>Future testing plans: heavy metals, nutrients, pesticides</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Restoration Activities</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Lake Ballinger/McAleer Creek Forum &#45; six governmental entities working to address flooding and water quality problems in the Lake Ballinger/McAleer Creek watershed.</li>
    <li>Long&#45;term, focused efforts to remove invasive plants and restore native riparian vegetation.</li>
    <li>Salmon raise and release projects: two elementary schools and two private property owners</li>
    <li>Wetland and riparian native planting efforts.</li>
  </ul>
