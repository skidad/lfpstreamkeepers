  Nine intrepid folks mustered on a foggy overcast morning to test
  water quality!
  Thanks, especially, to the Shorts, Dana and Roy, who were testing for the first time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Some details: All the teams had some degree of difficulty with the
  dissolved oxygen test chemicals, mainly the sulfamic acid (powder
  pillow #3). There were issues getting all the chemical out and
  getting it to dissolve completely. One team got a very low DO
  reading at the Lyon Creek mall site, which was re-tested two days
  later with more normal results. Some of those pillows could be
  several years old, and some of the liquid chemicals even
  older. We'll re-stock with fresh materials for the July testing.

  The team testing on McAleer Creek at 19th Ave. NE found an interesting
  plastic barrel in the stream.

  In checking with the property owner
  afterwards, it turns out it's a recently installed salmon hatching
  apparatus, permitted by WA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, with 4,000
  fertilized salmon eggs inside. A similar barrel has been installed on
  Lyon Creek on property owned by the same person. These are great
  additions to LFP's collective stream restoration efforts, and
  wonderful examples of local stewardship.
