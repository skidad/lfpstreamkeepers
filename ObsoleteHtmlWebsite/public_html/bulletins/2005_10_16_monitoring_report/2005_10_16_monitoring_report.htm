<p> <strong>Regular Quarterly Water Testing - </strong> 	    	    At 9AM Saturday morning October 15 we once  		    again had a good turnout  		    for the quarterly Chemical monitoring event.  		    Again the chemistry of  		    our streams looks to be in good shape.    		    The data has been collated and can be found at  		    under the data page on this web site.  		    </p>
<p>  		    <strong>Macroinvertebrate Sampling - </strong> 		    On October 1, after much preparation, two groups of volunteers visited  		    two sites on each stream and collected macroinvertebrate samples that 		    were then sent to be professionaly evaluated. 		    When the samples have been analyzed we will post the data on  		    the data page of this web site.  		    <a href="photos/index.htm">  		    <img style="border: 0px solid " vspace="20" hspace="30" align="right" src="bibi_2005_0_01_mcaleer_05_small.jpg" alt="BIBI Sampling Photos" title="BIBI Sampling Photos"> </a>  		    </p>
<p> 		    <strong>Why do Macroinvertebrate sampling?</strong> The best way to  		    assess the health  		    of a watershed for living things is to look at those living things.   		    Undisturbed watersheds in the Pacific Northwest contain a marvelous  		    variety of benthic macroinvertebrates, representing a smorgasbord of  		    shapes, sizes, survival strategies, and adaptations.  Human activities  		    that interfere with natural processes in a watershed have a definite  		    and predictable impact on the types and numbers of invertebrates  		    that live here. 		    </p>
<p> 		    Many invertebrates are just as sensitive to changes in their  		    environment as  		    salmon.  We tend to be more interested in fish than  		    invertebrates rather than  		    or along with fish. 		    </p>
<p> 		    It is easier and less intrusive to the environment  		    to sample invertebrates.  		    Whereas anadromous fish are impacted by a variety  		    of factors such as ocean  		    conditions and fishing pressures, stream  		    invertebrates are primarily impacted  		    by activities within their watershed.  		    </p>
<p> 		    Since invertebrates are an important food  		    source for fish (and other wildlife),  		    sampling them measures an environmental  		    component with a direct impact on fish.  		    Undisturbed streams have such a great  		    variety on invertebrates that sampling  		    can reveal subtle disturbances over space and time.  		    </p>
<p> 		    </p>
<p> <strong>Fecal Coliform Testing - </strong> 		    We are continuing the bacterial monitoring  		    that was started in the spring:  		    See the data posted on the data page of this web site.  		    </p>
