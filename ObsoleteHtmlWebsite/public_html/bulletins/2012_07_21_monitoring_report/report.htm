July 21 Water Testing Report

10 people showed up ready to hit the streams, more than enough for 4 teams. The group included two first-timers, LFP resident Jed Marshall, and Mountlake Terrace resident, Jim Walsh, who is interested in forming a stream group among the residents of his condominium association located on the main branch of Lyon Cr.
</p>
<p>
The results seemed in the range we like to see, although one site on McAleer had a temperature of 66 degrees, which stood out among the other results, all in the low 60's. The site is the first test location inside LFP, and is not far after the stream leaves Lake Ballinger. Maybe more downstream riffles tend to cool the water as it flows south.
</p>
<p>
The most interesting observation of the day was of several large koi in McAleer, along Perkins Way: three dead and one very much alive. On Monday several reports came my way of additional live koi sightings, possibly as many as eight in all. After consulting with City staffer, Aaron Halverson, we decided it would be prudent to remove the fish and try to find loving homes for them. We observed two on Tuesday, but when some Public Works guys went out Wednesday morning with nets and containers, the koi were gone.
</p>
<p>
But there's more: on Friday Aaron and I heard from Kim Josund of the LFP Stewardship Foundation, that her neighbor's teenage son and friends had removed three large koi from the stream earlier in the week, and found someone with a pond to take them. That still leaves a few renegade fish in the stream, and the people who originally reported them are keeping an eye out.
</p>
<p>
I talked with a UW fish biologist about koi in the stream. There are apparently lots of them (and other non-native fish) in Lake Washington. It's not clear how hazardous koi could be to the stream environment. His take was that we shouldn't be too concerned, although removing them when they are found is the prudent course. I'm not aware of any previous reports of koi in our streams. The consensus is they were probably dumped in the creek as a convenient way to dispose of them, or as a prank.
