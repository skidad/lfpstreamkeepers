<p>Ten people, including two students earning their community service credit and one Council member, went out before it rained and did the semi-annual testing. The group also discussed water-shed issues and activities in our community, and is planning an informal meeting to discuss the possibility of additional types of water quality testing in February. All are welcome!</p>
