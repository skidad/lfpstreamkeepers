	    Here's an update on current events of interest to
	    LFP StreamKeepers, in large part reflecting the team
	    meeting some of us attended back on March 21.  <p>
	    <B>Sensitive Areas Ordinance Hearing - </b> we discussed
	    the public hearing that took place on March 24, and Bill
	    Leon agreed to speak in favor of the proposed ordinance,
	    on behalf of those present at the meeting. The large
	    majority of other speakers at the hearing also endorsed
	    the proposal, which includes expanded buffers to protect
	    streams and wetlands in LFP. The proposed ordinance is now
	    under deliberation by the City Council.  
	    <p> <b>Fecal Coliform Testing - </b>
	    We are planning to collect water
	    samples from McAleer and Lyon Creeks for fecal coliform
	    testing by the City of Everett's environmental lab, on
	    Thursday, April 14. So far, Bill, Derek, Rick, and I are
	    tentatively signed up to do this in the morning, so the
	    samples can be delived that afternoon to the lab. Yes,
	    it's inconvenient, but apparently must be done that way to
	    ensure the quality of the samples. The collection process
	    is simple, basically just filling a container that the lab
	    has provided, at each site. We're going to aim for 5-6
	    sites on each stream. We could use another volunteer or
	    two, if anyone is interested. A lot of fecal coliform
	    testing was done (by the county, we think) during the
	    '90's, and the high levels found resulted in our streams
	    being listed on the State's list of endangered waters
	    list. So it seems like a good idea to see what the levels
	    are now. Also, we thought the testing might provide data
	    that would be useful in the current discussion in the City
	    about phasing out septic systems.  

	    <p> <b>BIBI Testing - </b>
	    last fall we initiated the Benthic Inventory of Biological
	    Integrity (BIBI) testing, which is simply taking an
	    inventory of the small creatures that live in our stream
	    beds. The analysis, which looks at both the number and
	    types of creatures, indicated that both our streams are in
	    "Poor" condition by this measure. We want to expand the
	    test locations next fall, and involve a few more people in
	    the collection process - probably do a practice/training
	    session over the summer. You can let me know if you would
	    like to get trained in the BIBI collection process, and
	    help with this. We do only the collection, and pay an
	    expert to do the actual analysis - hopefully, we can
	    secure Mindy Allen's services again this year.  

	    <p> <b>Jim Karr Visit - </b>
	    UW professor Jim Karr, who developed the BIBI
	    testing method, will be visiting the Saunders residence on
	    McAleer Cr., on the morning of Apr. 16. Jim Mead and Don
	    Fiene will join the gathering to meet Prof. Karr and hear
	    his thoughts on stream stewardship.  

	    <p> <b>Regular Quarterly Water Testing - </b>
	    Also on the 16th, we will be doing our
	    regular water quality testing. With Don, Jim, and David
	    tied up that morning, we'll really need as many of the
	    rest of us as possible to help out. Invite your friends
	    and neighbors! As usual, we'll meet at 9:00 in the lower
	    level of the mall, and testing takes about an hour and a
	    half. I'll be doing some phone calling, but please let me
	    know if you'll be able to participate. In case you missed
	    it, here's a link to an article the Enterprise did on our
	    water testing program last January:

	    <p> <b>Stream restoration/improvement projects -</b>
	    Adopt-A-Stream 
	    (<a href="http://www.streamkeeper.org/">http://www.streamkeeper.org/</a>)
	    has several projects in the works to
	    improve culverts for fish passage, at least one, on
	    Brookside Creek, in conjunction with the Stewardship
	    Foundation. They are also conducting a campaign to contact
	    and educate streamside residents in LFP about good stream
	    stewardship practices. There may be opportunities for us
	    to help with these activities, and with possible public
	    meetings, later in the spring and summer.  

	    <p> <b>Lake Ballinger improvement activities - </b>
	    The Lake
	    Ballinger Home Owners Assn. held their third meeting about
	    improving water level control and water quality, on March
	    30. I was able to attend, and let them know that we who
	    are downstream (Lk. Ballinger is the source of McAller
	    Creek) appreciate and suppport their efforts. They have
	    three jurisdictions to work with (Edmonds, Lynnwood, and
	    Mountlake Terrace), so they've got a lot of sorting out to
	    do. All three contribute storm run-off into the lake. I
	    believe MLT controls the wier mechanism used to control
	    water level, and there is concern that it is not working
	    properly. The scouring effects of high water run-off on
	    McAleer Cr. are a major concern for us. I met Mike Shaw,
	    the MLT Stormwater Program manager, and plan to follow up
	    with him. Plus - they've got two golf courses on the lake,
	    and it's not clear how actively they are pursuing good
	    water quality practices.
	    <p> <b>StreamKeepers of Lake Forest Park Website -</b> 
	    Derek has been laboring (Ed: Laboring? ha. more like 
	    procrastinating) over the fall and
	    winter months to get a "prototype" website up and
	    running. You can visit the site at 
	    <a href="http://lfpstreamkeepers.org">http://lfpstreamkeepers.org</a>.
	    It's a great start, and we should be
	    thinking of how we might like to see it extended or
	    modified. Derek is interested in more than "good ideas."
	    He needs appropriate text to back up our ideas, so he's
	    not stuck with all the research and writing. If you have
	    thoughts about this, please be in touch with Derek to see
	    how they might fit in.
