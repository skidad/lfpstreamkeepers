<h3>StreamKeepers 2008 Stream Report</h3>
<h3>November 2008 </h3>
<p>StreamKeeper volunteers continue to participate in
monitoring and other activities related to improving the aquatic
habitats in the stream systems—McAleer and Lyon
Creeks—that
run through Lake Forest Park. The creeks flow through our City down
steep ravines, through City parks, and&nbsp;residents’
back yards before flowing into Lake
Washington. As many of those streamside residents can attest, high
water flows cause more regular flooding and other longer-term changes
to the streams.&nbsp;</p>

Activities and Results</a></h4>


StreamKeepers checked basic water quality at 11 locations in January
and July, and conducted macroinvertebrate inventory (BIBI) testing in
October. Four new monitors participated, including an awesome
mother-daughter team.
<h3> <img title="Mother daughter team plus one" alt="Mother daughter team plus one" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 174px; height: 138px; float: right" src="IMGP1819_BIBI-Derek5.jpg" hspace="15"></h3>


The January 2008 basic water quality monitoring results for all factors
were very good. However, the July 2008 results showed low levels of
dissolved oxygen (DO) at two locations on Lyon Cr. (Brugger’s
Bog
and near 185th and 35th) and on two tributaries of McAleer Cr.
(Hillside and Brookside Creeks). The low DO locations ranged from 6.5
– 8.5. DO levels of 10 mg/liter are considered very good for
fish, insects and other animals living in the streams. <br>
<br>




The City’s 2009 budget includes $2,500 for upgrading and
expanding water quality testing equipment.<br>

In October 2008, StreamKeepers conducted the annual macroinvertebrate
inventory (BIBI) at two locations on each of our streams.
Macroinvertebrates include flies, beetles, worms and mollusks that live
all or part of their lifecycles in the streambeds. The numbers and
types of these creatures in a stream are considered indicators of
overall biological health. StreamKeepers uses a sample collection
method developed by a UW professor, Jim Karr. Our samples are sent to a
specially trained entomologist for analysis and evaluation. &nbsp;

On a stream health scale of 10 – 50, Lyon Cr. Scored 16 at
both
locations and McAleer scored a 24 and a 26. These are considered Very
Poor and Poor, and they are consistent with previous years’
results.&nbsp; They indicate that our streams, like many other
streams
in urban areas, are struggling to remain viable for fish and other
aquatic wildlife. Pollutants in stormwater runoff undoubtedly
contribute to low biological stream health, but it is thought that the
main cause is increased sedimentation from high volume water flows.
Macroinvertebrates live in the spaces around and under rocks on the
streambed. Heavy sediment deposits fill in those spaces, displacing
oxygen-bearing water, and suffocating the tiny creatures that live
there. Sedimentation also covers over salmon spawning areas, and kills
eggs that may have been buried in the gravel. <br>

What we have learned about our streams in 2008 points to their
continued fragility. They remain beautiful and wonderful assets for the
community, but they are being pushed to the edge, and we must all make
every effort to respect and protect them.<br>

Against that backdrop, salmon did return to our streams in 2008. One
Chinook (King) and eleven Sockeye were observed on McAleer Cr. The

An LFP resident (44th Avenue) found the carcass of a 24”
female
Coho (or Silver) salmon on lower Lyon Cr. and contacted a member of
StreamKeepers. This is good news in that there have been no reported
salmon sightings on Lyon Cr. in many years, but bad news in that it was
later confirmed that the fish died before being able to spawn. <br>
<br><img style="width: 230px; height: 115px; float: right" alt="Pre Spawning Death Syndrome" title="Pre Spawning Death Syndrome" src="Pre_Spawning_Death_Syndrome_of_a_female_Coho_11-9-08%20001.jpg">According
to NOAA researchers, there is currently a very strong trend
for 60-100% of the returning female Coho salmon to become disoriented
and die within hours of entering many Puget Sound area streams. This
phenomenon is known as Pre-Spawn Mortality (PSM). The cause is unknown,
but one or more of the pollutants (particularly copper), which are
washed into the streams, are the prime suspect. NOAA has now listed
Lyon Creek as a PSM stream. (A second Coho was also found dead, but it
was not confirmed as PSM.)<br>

Improvement Efforts</a></h4></p>
<p>One very positive way our streams improved during the year was by significant removal of invasive ivy and knotweed plants that have become widely established in many riparian areas. These invasives colonize aggressively (knotweed root fragments as small as ½” can produce a new plant) and choke out beneficial native streamside plants, thereby reducing habitat for birds, mammals, and other organisms. <br>
<br>A group of about a half dozen dedicated volunteers, led by the LFP Stewardship Foundation, worked many weekends throughout the year removing ivy and knotweed. In response to an article in the June Town Crier, some 15 residents called to ask for help with knotweed removal on their properties, and were referred to the volunteer crew.&nbsp; </p>

to the
Future</a><br>
</h4>
<p>
Lake Forest Park is involved in three major efforts that can
potentially be very beneficial to our streams in the future. </p>
<ol>
<li>The city’s stormwater management
program is
being updated and expanded to better control surface water runoff and
meet new state and federal water quality requirements. &nbsp;</li>
<li>A Lake Ballinger/McAleer Watershed Forum was
formed
via an interlocal agreement (ILA) about a year ago. The group is made
up of elected officials and staff from five cities (including Lake
Forest Park) and Snohomish County, to resolve watershed issues,
primarily flooding, around Lake Ballinger and along McAleer Cr. The
group is using a $200,000 grant from Washington State to conduct a
comprehensive watershed study. Preliminary&nbsp; recommendations
are
expected by next spring.</li>
<li>The city is pursuing another interlocal agreement ,
this one with cities in the Lyon Creek Watershed. &nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>The City is also working in partnership with King
County
to get stream flow monitoring gauges installed on McAleer and Lyon
Creeks. The data collected is an important step in understanding water
volume issues within the City.<br>
<br>


StreamKeepers will meet next for basic water quality testing, on
Saturday Jan. 17, at 9:00 a.m. in the lower level of the Town Center.
Anyone interested in helping with this activity and learning more about
our streams is invited to attend. <br>

particularly encouraged to participate, as a way to earn
community service credits and learn more about their local environment.
All are welcome.<br>
