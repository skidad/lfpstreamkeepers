<p><br>Convening two weeks after scheduled date, due to postponement
because of concerns about high water and safety, we had a good morning.
We picked up&nbsp;one
enthusiastic new member - Dave Farkas who is also a member of the
Env'l. Quality Commission.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The results were very much in line with previous testing. Temps ranged
from 45 to 48 F; pH at 7.5 with the exception of one site that was
recorded at 6.5; dissolved oxygen ranging from 10 - 14 mg/l. One site
(Bruggers Bog) tested at 4 and 5 for DO - extremely low - so Mark
Phillips&nbsp;went back&nbsp;to re-test and got results of 12
and 13. His guess is that&nbsp;it was a problem with the test - bad
chemicals, not emptying the whole amount from the packets, air bubbles
in the jar, although it seems&nbsp;that would tend to push the DO
in the sample up. We might want to add a step to our procedure that in
the case of a very low reading, go ahead and retest completely,
starting with fresh chemicals.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Adam Officer accompanied one of the teams and did some side-by-side DO
testing with the meter. The meter and the chemical process were pretty
close, even closer than the previous side-by-sides: 11.6 (meter) vs.
12, and 11.9 vs. 12.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One thing of note is that the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lfpsf.org/">LFP
Stewardship Foundation</a> has submitted a grant application to
do an engineering design study of the Ballinger Automotive site (across
the street from the LFP market on Ballinger), which Stream Keeper Mark
Phillips&nbsp;helped to write. That is the site of a culvert
collapse back in 1996, and has been a major barrier to fish passage and
source of siltation since then. The grant would fund work to figure out
the best restoration option and create a related detailed construction
plan. The application lists StreamKeepers as a project partner, so if
it is funded, our input and other participation will be sought. They'll
find out if they got it in March.<br>
