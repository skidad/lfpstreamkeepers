            <p>Two solid teams of folks worked the Fall 2010 BIBI Sampling event.

<p>The McAleer Cr. team observed a coho salmon just upstream of the
viewing deck at Animal Acres. There may have been more as they did not
have a great look. The collection site is about 100 yds downstream from
there, so they&nbsp;decided to go ahead without disurbing the salmon. 
</p>
<p>The collected samples for the four stream sites were analysed by a
private aquatic entomologist. The results show that the BIBI scores for
two of the sites (one on Mcaleer and one on Lyon) improved from last
year. One site scored lower than last year, and one site scored the
same. The scores are will be available in the Compiled BIBI section of
the Data page soon.
 </p>
<p> It was great having teen age Streamkeepers Lacey, Amelia, Niva, and
Cohen with us. They worked hard and quickly became very proficient!
Lacey mentioned a BIBI project she is working on for a HS biology
class, and we talked about possibly displaying related materials at
Third Place Commons. We also welcome an enthusiastic
new Streamkeeper, Dave Farkas, who would like to be out sampling
monthly or even weekly!
