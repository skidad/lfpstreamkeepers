<h3>Saturday April 16, 2005 Monitoring Report</h3>             </td><td align="right"> 	      <small>April 16, 2005</small>             </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> 	    Despite the pouring rain we had a good turnout of about 10 people 	    Saturday morning at 9AM.  We will post the data when we have it collated.  	   
<p><strong>A Question: </strong>During the preliminary discussion we had a question  	    come up that we've all heard before: Who do you call when you see something 	    funny in the streams? One of this days streamkeepers has seen the stream in  	    her back yard turn white on several occasions in the past few years, most  	    recently within the past couple of weeks.  	    Our best answer was call Frank Zenk at the City of 	    Lake Forest Park.  We would like to have a definitive answer to this  	    question. There are a number of agencies including Washington Department 	    of Ecology, Washington Fish and Wildlife that have some jurisdiction.  	    </p></td></tr></tbody></table>       </td></tr></tbody></table>
