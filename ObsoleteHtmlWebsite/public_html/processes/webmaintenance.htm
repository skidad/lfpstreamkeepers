      <div><strong>Current Hosting Details </strong><br>


      </div>


      
      <div>As of October 7, 2008: lfpstreamkeepers.org is hosted at
100megsWebhosting.com and Domain registration is done at
100MegsDomains.com</div>


      
      <div>$50 per year for hosting (Paid through Oct 2009) </div>


      
      <div>Domain&nbsp; registration: $12.95 a year (Paid through Nov 2010) </div>


      
      <div>Note that Derek took $80 in donations from other Stream
Keepers for web hosting at October 2007 benthic meeting. . . So I
should be good for donations through 2009.</div>


      
      <div>Reasons for 100Megs: </div>


      
      <div>
      
      <ul>


        <li>On comcast personal page: URL's were obscured so reloads go back to home page rather than expected page<br>


        </li>


        <li>Like the hosting service because it keeps things in one
place. 100Megs was the choice because I'm using it for other sites:
Could probably have gotten cheaper hosting else where but $60 a year
seems OK.</li>


        <li>100Megs does seem to have great support.<br>


        </li>


        <li>Using 100megs domains because it has free URL forwarding and is $3 cheaper a year.&nbsp;<strong><br>


          </strong></li>

      
      </ul>

      <p>100Megswebhosting says we have 50Mbyte limit (seen via
cpanel). The starter plan is suposed to have 10Gbytes. Submitted a
support ticket asking them to increase the amount.&nbsp;<strong> <br>

        </li>


        <li>Tried to make sure that hosting was paid for through next
year, but was thwarted by web interface at
support.100megswebhosting.com : I believe that hosting is auto renew so
should be good, but am uncomfortable.&nbsp; </li>

      <div>I have signed up lfpstreamkeepers for hosting at 100megswebhosting.com.</div>


      
      <div>Used 100megs because I have the Snoqualmienordic website
hosted there and I am familiar with it. Probably could have found
something a bit cheaper, but ~$60 a year seems ok for the convenience
of working with something that I am familiar with. </div>

      <div><strong>October 20, 2007: Details of Comcast hosting</strong></div>


      
      <div>For posterity here are the details of how this site was hosted at on a Comcast home email account:</div>


      
      <div> 						The domain name "lfpstreamkeepers.org" was registered through <a href="http://www.dotster.com/"> 							http://www.dotster.com</a> : 						</div>


      
      <p>     						Nov 13, 2004: Bought 2 years usage of the domain for $27.95<br>


                          						Nov 2006: Extended subscription through Nov 13, 2007. 					</p>

   					
      
      <p>Traffic to lfpstreamkeepers.org was redirected to
http://home.comcast.net/~lfpstreamkeepers which is a personal website
managed by Derek brown. (sk1dad@comcast.net) </p>

  					
      
      <p>Redirection was managed using MyWebHop on <a href="http://dyndns.org/">http://dyndns.org</a>,                          <br>


                                                  $24.95 for redirection service from Dec 16, 2006 to Dec 16, 2007. </p>

      </div>


      
      <div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sept 30, 2007: Considering Hosting Service</span></div>


      
      <div>
      
      <p>   I am considering signing lfpstreamkeepers.org with a hosting service: In particular <a target="_blank" href="http://www.100megswebhosting.com/">http://www.100megswebhosting.com/</a></p>

Because I already have another website hosted there and I am comfortble
with it. At this time we pay about $55 a year for on going maintenance,
so If I can sign up for $5 a month for web hosting at 100 Megs and they
can throw in the domain registration I think we will be better off and
paying abut the same. There are a number of things I don't like about
hosting on the comcast site: <br>


      
      <ul>


        <li>The domain name redirection makes all pages look like the
home page to browsers and can confuse things: External links can be
loaded under the stramkeepers URL.</li>


        <li>I'd like to divorce the Streamkeepers website from my
personal internet connection, just to free up the email address and
site for more personal use.</li>


        <li>Uploading to Comcast is a struggle using FTP: I don't seem to have the same timeout issues with 100 Megs.</li>

       
      
      </ul>

I "Passed the hat" at the yesterday monitoring session and easily got
$80 donations that would cover hosting service for a year.</div>
